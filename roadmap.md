# Roadmap for story editor

* Keybindings are function and in good agromatic possition.
* All features applied. It's not feature full yet until I figure out all that is needed by real time use.
* Formating is finished all bold, underline strikethough.  (dropped or added any if needed thinking of dropping strikethrough)
  * ## Feature list
  * Can do basic formating (bold strikethrough, underline, etc)
  * Works on small screens
  * Shortcuts can be used without thinking.
  * bottom menu bar shows only info needed.
  * Shouldn't need a help menu but has one.
  * Exports to markdown and bbcode
  * Has it's own file format. 

* # Testing issues
* Need italics not strikethough
* need to save as inside so I can name it not having to make it via argument
* start formating block without needing to highlight. ex ctrl+B everything is bold now until I turn if off

* # Future notes
* Export as fountain and more formats.
* Fix any bugs that come up after testing begins
* Old projects like the one for my markup language to writing format can be used
* Merge old xml format to it. (Keep wpm but add more from teh old one.  THen kill project)
* Add wordwrap (soft)
* Merge old PWA if possible to replace old one. then kill old pwa project
